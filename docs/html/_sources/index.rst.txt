Welcome to StatUS's documentation!
==================================

StatUS is a tool for the loop of training AI, and running them through "games" to generate data to train better and better AI.

Check the quickstart guides at `https://github.com/mtcade/StatUS <https://github.com/mtcade/StatUS/>`_

This implementation makes extensive use of the `JyFrame` class from `jable`, another one of my packages for handling simple tabular data sets as `.json`:

    * `https://github.com/mtcade/Jable<https://mtcade.github.io/Jable/html/index.html>_`
    * `https://mtcade.github.io/Jable/html/index.html<https://mtcade.github.io/Jable/html/index.html>`_
